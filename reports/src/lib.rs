//! Management reports, module `finance/reports` (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Reports`): a company's figures read live from its general
//! ledger: profit and loss for date ranges, the balance sheet and the cash
//! position as of dates, headline figures for a period against the one before
//! it, and the entries behind any account's figure. They are management
//! reports for the company's own use, not statutory financial statements. The
//! module also retains source-period conversion schedules as evidence without
//! turning them into postings, tax returns, payroll runs or remittances.
//!
//! Every report figure comes from the [`Ledger`] facade; this module stores
//! issued snapshots and source-period evidence and reads none of the ledger's
//! tables. Every function takes the sealed [`Scope`] it was handed and an
//! explicit company id, and authorizes
//! the ledger's view capability (`finance.ledger.view`) for the scope's actor
//! and that company when it runs, through Core Company's `authorize_target`: a
//! missing grant, or a sibling company without tenant-wide reach, is
//! [`ReportsError::Unauthorized`], and a company the scope cannot see is
//! [`ReportsError::CompanyNotFound`]. Issuing a report asks for
//! [`ISSUE`] as well.
//!
//! A report names `through_entry_number`, the last ledger entry it counts, and
//! every column of one report is read at that same number, so passing it back
//! reproduces the postings counted. It does not freeze the chart, account
//! names or the layout: cash membership and section totals can still change.
//! [`Reports::issue_report`] stores a durable issued copy, and
//! [`Reports::get_issued_report`] reads it back without recomputing anything.
//!
//! Accounts are grouped by their type and, within a type, by the sections the
//! company configures in the [`SECTIONS`] setting (see `layout.rs`). Section
//! headings and account choices are the company's data; a report reads them as
//! they are when it runs.
