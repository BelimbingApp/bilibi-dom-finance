//! What a company has set up in Finance and what remains, read through each
//! module's facade (Bilimbi has no counterpart: this is a Bilibi page and
//! contract, `finance.reports.setup.get`).
//!
//! Reports is the one Finance module that depends on every other, so the
//! overview lives here and no module learns of another. Each area reports only
//! what its owner can determine: a module's own setup record exists or it does
//! not. An area with nothing to measure (accountant access, opening balances)
//! has the state `not_tracked`; it is a link, never a completion claim.
//!
//! The overview works for one company named by the caller, which is the
//! current company on the page and any reachable company for an agent. Every
//! facade call proves its own capability for that company, so an area the
//! person may not read is `no_access`, apart from one that is `not_set_up`.
