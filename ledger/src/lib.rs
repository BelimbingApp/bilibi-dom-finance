//! The general ledger, module `finance/ledger` (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Ledger`): a company's book, chart of accounts, journal
//! entries, fiscal years and their closing, controlled bookkeeping and late
//! recordings, reversals, the separation of duties with its approval
//! exceptions, and manual journals. Other Finance modules post, reverse and
//! ask for approvals through this facade; none reads its tables.
//!
//! Every function takes the sealed [`Scope`] it was handed and an explicit
//! company id. Reads authorize `finance.ledger.view` and writes their own
//! capability for the scope's actor and the target company at the moment
//! they run, through Core Company's `authorize_target`: a missing grant, or a
//! sibling company without tenant-wide reach, is
//! [`LedgerError::Unauthorized`], and a company the scope cannot see is
//! [`LedgerError::CompanyNotFound`]. A write then holds the company's row
//! lock for its mutation transaction, so an archived company is
//! [`LedgerError::CompanyArchived`] and the company's ledger writes run one
//! at a time.
//!
//! A book is opened once per company with its currency code and that
//! currency's number of decimal places; both are fixed for good, because
//! every posted amount is denominated in them ([`Money`]). A new company's
//! book opens controlled (see `bookkeeping.rs`). Accounts are never deleted
//! and keep their code and type; the one equity account designated for
//! retained earnings receives the year-end close.
//!
//! A company divides its time into fiscal years of monthly periods. Periods
//! close in date order and reopen in reverse; a reopen needs a reason and the
//! reopen capability, and a locked period never reopens.
//! [`Ledger::close_fiscal_year`] posts the entry that moves the year's income
//! and expense balances into retained earnings and closes the year with its
//! periods. Every close, reopen and lock is an append-only closing event, and
//! a status is the latest event's. A controlled company posts only into a
//! period it has opened and left open; an entry is never refused for being
//! old, but one recorded 45 or more days after its date is listed for an
//! independent review. A reopen, and turning controlled bookkeeping off,
//! override a control and are recorded as approval exceptions.
//!
//! A posted entry is never edited or deleted: [`Ledger::reverse_entry`] posts
//! its mirror image, once. An entry another module owns is corrected only
//! through that module, which calls [`Ledger::reverse_owned_entry`] inside the
//! transaction that records its own reversal. The owner is a seam between
//! modules, not an authorization boundary: the ledger cannot tell which module
//! is calling, so a caller holding `finance.ledger.entries.post` that passes an
//! entry's owner from anywhere else reverses it without the owner's record, and
//! the owner's control-account tie-out then shows the difference.
//!
//! A company requires separation of duties unless it turns it off: the person
//! who approves a record, or whoever impersonated them, is not the person who
//! prepared it, nor anyone they impersonated. [`Ledger::check_approval`] is how
//! every Finance approval asks, inside the approving transaction, and it
//! records what an independent reviewer reads: a same-person approval while
//! separation is off, and an override of a control. A manual journal is
//! submitted and posts only once someone approves it
//! ([`Ledger::submit_journal`], [`Ledger::approve_journal`]); its submitter may
//! withdraw or correct it while it waits ([`Ledger::withdraw_journal`],
//! [`Ledger::replace_journal`]).
//!
//! Figures are summed by PostgreSQL ([`Ledger::trial_balance`],
//! [`Ledger::account_totals`], [`Ledger::account_totals_by_owner`]) and name
//! the last entry number they count, which reproduces them exactly: entries
//! are numbered in posting order and never change. [`Ledger::evidence_page`]
//! exports each table for the auditor's pack.
//!
//! Results are plain records; the schema, SQL and validation stay private.
