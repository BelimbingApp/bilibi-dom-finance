//! The bridge from a cleared document to the company's ledger (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Einvoice.Posting` and `Clearance.retry_posting/3`,
//! `retry_reversal/4`).
//!
//! A document the authority validated posts one balanced entry through the
//! ledger's `post_entry_in`, as the person the work runs for, dated the
//! document's issue date (a consolidated document's, the last day of the month
//! it reports, so the month's revenue stays in that month), with the
//! document's code number and authority UUID in the entry's `reference`. The
//! accounts come from the company's `finance.einvoice.posting.*` settings, by
//! account code in its own chart; nothing here names an account, and the
//! authority's `posting_rule` says which settings each document type posts
//! to. The counter-account (receivable, payable or settlement) takes the
//! rule's side for the gross amount; the net (revenue or expense) and tax
//! accounts take the other side. A tax of zero posts no tax line.
//!
//! The entry names the document as its owner (`finance/einvoice`,
//! `document:<id>`), so the ledger refuses a second entry for it and a
//! reversal from anywhere but here. Its ID is recorded on a `posted` status
//! event, and a cancelled document's entry is reversed with
//! `reverse_owned_entry` and recorded on a `posting_reversed` event, so an
//! auditor walks document to UUID to entry. A document issued with a source
//! (another module already recognised its transaction) never posts and never
//! reverses: its accounting, and its correction, are that module's.
//!
//! An entry and the event naming it are one transaction under the company's
//! writable lock, so a document never has an entry without its `posted`
//! event, and the database refuses a second `posted` or `posting_reversed`
//! event. A posting that cannot happen (accounts unset, book not open,
//! currency mismatch, missing grant, a ledger refusal) is recorded as
//! `posting_failed` or `reversal_failed` with its reason, in a transaction of
//! its own once the first has rolled back, and the reconciliation read lists
//! the document until a retry succeeds. Only a database failure that may pass
//! at once (a lost connection, lock contention, a serialization failure) is
//! tried a second time, as a fresh transaction, and recorded as one failure
//! that says it was tried twice; every ledger refusal is final, and a closed
//! period is never reopened to post.
