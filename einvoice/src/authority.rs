//! The clearance authority a company's documents go to (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Einvoice.Authority`).
//!
//! The facade, tables and pages speak only of fiscal documents, parties,
//! submissions and status events. Everything one authority defines (its rules,
//! code lists, document format, signature, API and the shape of its answers)
//! sits behind this trait in that authority's own module. This release clears
//! documents with one authority, MyInvois (`myinvois.rs`).
//!
//! The callbacks that take a draft or a recorded document (draft validation
//! and the payload) and the API callbacks (login, submit, progress, find,
//! status, cancel) are here with their types. Each API callback answers in
//! meta-terms ([`Answer`] and an outcome enum), keeping the authority's own
//! answer beside it so a caller can store it as the record. The consolidated
//! document's shape and refusal are the authority's too; none of
//! them is invented before then.
