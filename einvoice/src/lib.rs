//! E-invoicing, module `finance/einvoice` (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Einvoice`): the fiscal documents a company issues through
//! a clearance authority. This version holds the schema, the company's setup
//! (settings, credentials, signing certificate with its facts, and supplier
//! profile, read here without any secret), the [`Authority`] contract with
//! the one authority this release clears documents with (MyInvois) and its
//! rules: the [`Draft`] a caller asks to issue and its validation, the UBL
//! 2.1 JSON builder with its byte-exact writer, the JSON XAdES signer, and
//! the authority's code lists with each company's overrides; clearance
//! (issuing, submitting, refreshing and cancelling a document); and the
//! ledger bridge: a validated document's one owned entry and a cancelled
//! one's reversal, retried from the reconciliation read, source links to the
//! entry another Finance module already posted, the monthly consolidated
//! document, the printable PDF on Base Artifacts with the validation link's
//! QR code, and the auditor's evidence datasets. Other modules never read its
//! tables.
//!
//! Every function takes the sealed [`Scope`] it was handed and an explicit
//! company id. Reads authorize their capability and writes theirs for the
//! scope's actor and the target company at the moment they run, through Core
//! Company's `authorize_target`: a missing grant, or a sibling company without
//! tenant-wide reach, is [`EinvoiceError::Unauthorized`], and a company the
//! scope cannot see is [`EinvoiceError::CompanyNotFound`]. A write then holds
//! the company's row lock inside an audited mutation transaction, so an
//! archived company is [`EinvoiceError::CompanyArchived`].
