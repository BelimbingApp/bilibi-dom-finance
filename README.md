# bilibi-dom-finance

Finance Domain for [Bilibi](https://github.com/BelimbingApp/bilibi): a
company's bookkeeping, ported with exact parity from Bilimbi's
[b-dom-finance](https://github.com/BelimbingApp/b-dom-finance). It is one
optional, independently versioned repository that an adopter mounts into a
Bilibi checkout; it does not build on its own.

| Module | Descriptor ID | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`ledger/`](ledger/README.md) | `finance/ledger` | each company's book and currency, its chart of accounts, and the controlled-bookkeeping setting a new book opens with, and its journal entries (append-only, numbered without gaps, balanced at commit, optionally owned by another module's record) with posting notices that announce only committed entries. Periods, journals and the other controls follow in later versions of the module. |
| [`attachments/`](attachments/README.md) | `finance/attachments` | source documents kept with the records they support: records-grade files in Base Artifacts, the company's retention years and their history, replace and remove while a record is a draft, legal holds, and the retention refresh job that follows a record's final date. The `Source` contract each record owner implements is here. |

Every other Finance module of Bilimbi (receivables, payables,
e-invoice, fixed assets, payroll, reconciliation, SST, reports) lands beside
the ledger as a sibling module folder, in later slices of the port.

## Mount

Clone this repository into a Bilibi checkout at `apps/domains/finance` (a real
nested checkout, never a symlink), then work from the Bilibi root:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BelimbingApp/bilibi-dom-finance.git apps/domains/finance
python3 scripts/discover-modules.py
cargo build -p bilibi-web
DATABASE_URL=… ./target/debug/bilibi-web migrate
```

Bilibi discovers the mounted container from `bilibi.container.toml`; no list
names it. Removing the directory removes Finance's code from the next build and
keeps its data: the migration ledger keeps an unmounted module's applied
versions. The composition rules are in Bilibi's `apps/domains/AGENTS.md`.

## Walkthrough fixture

`fixtures/walkthrough/` is an example-only crate (never a product dependency)
that installs the Platform's walkthrough fixture and then opens Company 001's
book and chart of accounts through the ledger facade. Its binary is the
running proof of this repository's facade:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://…/disposable cargo run -p bilibi-finance-walkthrough-fixture
```

It migrates a fresh disposable database, installs the fixtures, and prints
the facade's answers to accepted and refused books, accounts, entries (owners,
settlement accounts, concurrent posts, paged reads), reach (grants,
affiliation, tenancy, archival), money finer than the book allows, the
database's own refusals (edits to posted entries, unbalanced or lineless
entries, cross-company keys) and the posting notices a commit, a rollback and
a refusal do and do not send. Its attachments section does the same for
source documents: the company's retention years, attaching and capturing
files, replacing and removing on a draft record, a final record that keeps its
files, retention extensions and legal holds (including a change made in Base
Artifacts out of band), the retention refresh job as its system principal
before and after a tenant grants it, evidence pages, restricted sources, an
archived company and the database's own refusals.

## Naming

Optional Bilibi repositories are named `bilibi-<role>-<id>`: `dom-` for a
Domain. The mount folder is the container ID in snake_case, so
`bilibi-dom-finance` mounts at `apps/domains/finance`. Module crates are
`bilibi-finance-<module>`, capability keys `finance.<module>.*`, tables
`finance_<module>_*` and migrations `finance-<module>-NNN-<slug>`, all as
Bilimbi names them.

## CI

CI is Bilibi's reference Domain workflow (`docs/domain-ci/ci.yml`): it checks
out Bilibi at the revision in [`.github/bilibi-revision`](.github/bilibi-revision),
mounts this repository, and runs `scripts/domain-ci.sh` over the composed
workspace (discovery, committed CSS, Cargo.lock pinning, fmt, clippy with
`-D warnings`, the locked release build, migrate, seed-production and a boot
that loads `/`). Bump that revision to build against a newer Platform.
