//! The record a source document supports, as the module that owns the record
//! describes it (Bilimbi `Bilimbi.Finance.Attachments.Source`).
//!
//! A Finance module that keeps source documents contributes one [`Source`]
//! per kind of record (a bill, a payment request, an invoice, a bank
//! statement) under the id `<its module id>/<record kind>`
//! (`finance/payables/bill`), the id stored with each attachment. The
//! attachments facade asks it again on every read and write.
//!
//! `view_capability` is what the owning module asks to read its records:
//! every metadata read of an attachment (`get_attachment`, the lists, the
//! source documents page) also needs it and leaves out the attachments of a
//! source whose records the caller cannot read, so the attachments grant
//! alone discloses no record's label, file name or date. `document` reads the
//! record with the caller's scope on the caller's connection, so it sees the
//! caller's uncommitted writes, and answers:
//!
//! - `label`: how the record is named to a person (`"Bill 12"`), kept with
//!   the attachment for the index and the auditor's pack;
//! - `date`: the record's own date, which decides the financial year the
//!   retention counts from. A record whose date can change while it is not
//!   final (a draft invoice) makes its module call
//!   [`crate::Attachments::refresh_retention`] once the record is final,
//!   inside the transaction that finalises it, so the retention follows the
//!   final date;
//! - `is_final`: whether the record is beyond change (posted, issued,
//!   approved, imported), after which its attachments are kept as they are:
//!   one can still be added, none replaced or removed.
//!
//! The source authorizes the read itself (a missing grant is
//! [`SourceRefusal::Unauthorized`], a missing record
//! [`SourceRefusal::NotFound`]); the attachments facade never reads the
//! owner's tables.
