//! Source documents, module `finance/attachments` (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Attachments`): the supplier's invoice scan behind a bill,
//! a remittance behind a payment, a contract behind an invoice, a voucher
//! behind a manual journal, the bank's own file behind an imported statement.
//!
//! Every function takes the sealed [`Scope`] it was handed and an explicit
//! company id. Reads authorize `finance.attachments.view` and writes their
//! own capability (`finance.attachments.create` to attach or replace,
//! `finance.attachments.delete` to remove, and
//! `finance.attachments.retention.manage` to lengthen the company's retention
//! or an attachment's, or to place and release a legal hold) for the scope's
//! actor and the target company at the moment they run, through Core
//! Company's `authorize_target`: a missing grant, or a sibling company
//! without tenant-wide reach, is [`AttachmentError::Unauthorized`], and a
//! company the scope cannot see is [`AttachmentError::CompanyNotFound`]. A
//! write then holds the company's row lock for its mutation transaction, so
//! an archived company is [`AttachmentError::CompanyArchived`].
//!
//! The record an attachment supports is described by a [`Source`] the module
//! that owns it contributes (see `source.rs`), which reads the record with the
//! same scope: an attachment also needs whatever that source asks to read the
//! record, and answers the source's refusal when it is not readable. Reading
//! an attachment's metadata ([`Attachments::get_attachment`], the lists)
//! needs the source's `view_capability` as well as
//! `finance.attachments.view`: a list leaves out the attachments of every
//! source the caller cannot read, and a single read or a retention change of
//! one is [`AttachmentError::Unauthorized`].
//!
//! The file's bytes are a records-grade document in Base Artifacts: stored
//! once, hashed, and retained until the company's retention years
//! ([`Attachments::get_retention`]; seven until the company lengthens it) have
//! passed after the end of the financial year the record's date falls in.
//! Base refuses to delete the bytes before then, and a legal hold refuses it
//! after. A change of retention ([`Attachments::extend_retention`],
//! [`Attachments::place_hold`], [`Attachments::release_hold`]) is made in Base
//! Artifacts first, after a short transaction under the company lock has
//! checked it, and its event follows without the lock; Base is the fact, so
//! [`Attachments::get_attachment`] and [`Attachments::read_attachment`] append
//! any retention event Base holds and this module does not before answering,
//! and an event that could not be recorded after Base applied the change is
//! [`AttachmentError::RecordedInStorage`].
//!
//! An attachment row is the link from the record to that artifact with the
//! file's name, type, size, SHA-256, retain-until, and who captured it when;
//! it is never changed. Its standing is its latest event: a draft record's
//! attachment can be replaced ([`Attachments::replace`], which captures the
//! new file and records `replaced` on the old) or removed
//! ([`Attachments::remove`], an event with its reason), and once the record is
//! final (posted, issued, approved, imported) its attachments are kept as
//! they are, though one can still be added. A replaced or removed
//! attachment's bytes stay retained and readable from its history; nothing
//! here deletes them.
//!
//! Base Artifacts stores a file outside any transaction, so
//! [`Attachments::attach`] stores the bytes first and records the link in its
//! own transaction; a record inserted in the same transaction as its file (a
//! bank statement) uses [`Attachments::capture_file`] before the transaction
//! and [`Attachments::attach_capture`] inside it. A storage refusal
//! ([`AttachmentError::RetentionNotConfigured`] until an operator sets Base
//! Artifacts' storage root and retention, [`AttachmentError::InvalidSize`]
//! over its limit) stores nothing.
//!
//! Results are plain records; the schema, SQL and validation stay private.
