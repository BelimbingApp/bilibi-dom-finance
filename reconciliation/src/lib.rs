//! Bank reconciliation, module `finance/reconciliation` (Bilimbi
//! `Bilimbi.Finance.Reconciliation`): a company's bank accounts, each mapped
//! to one ledger account and carrying the import mapping its bank's CSV export
//! is read through, and the bank statements imported for them; the opening
//! bridge between an approved opening entry, the source statement and its
//! outstanding items; the matches between statement lines and the book side;
//! the reconciliations of an account as of a statement end date; and the bank
//! charges and interest posted from statement lines.
//!
//! Every function takes the sealed [`Scope`] it was handed and an explicit
//! company id. Reads authorize `finance.reconciliation.view` and writes their
//! own capability for the scope's actor and the target company at the moment
//! they run, through Core Company's `authorize_target`: a missing grant, or a
//! sibling company without tenant-wide reach, is
//! [`ReconciliationError::Unauthorized`], and a company the scope cannot see
//! is [`ReconciliationError::CompanyNotFound`]. A write then holds the
//! company's row lock for its mutation transaction, so an archived company is
//! [`ReconciliationError::CompanyArchived`] and the company's reconciliation
//! writes run one at a time.
//!
//! The ledger is read only through `finance/ledger`'s facade with the same
//! scope, so a call that reads the chart (adding or changing a bank account)
//! or the book (importing a statement) also needs `finance.ledger.view`, and
//! the file an import keeps needs `finance.attachments.create`: each facade
//! authorizes its own calls.
//!
//! A bank account names an active asset account of the ledger that no other
//! bank account maps, and keeps it for good. Its name, counter accounts, match
//! window, import mapping and active flag change in place, and every change
//! is appended to its change log with the field, the values before and after,
//! the actor, the reason and the database's time. A bank account is never
//! deleted; deactivate it, and it imports and reconciles no more.
//!
//! A statement and its lines are inserted in one transaction, together with
//! the file itself kept whole as the statement's source document through
//! `finance/attachments` ([`STATEMENT_SOURCE`]), and are never changed or
//! deleted. Opening bridges expose their retained source statements through
//! [`OPENING_BRIDGE_SOURCE`]. The same statement file (by SHA-256) and the
//! same line (by fingerprint) are refused a second time; PostgreSQL refuses
//! them on its own as well.
//!
//! A match groups statement lines of a bank account with ledger entries on
//! its ledger account, or with one outstanding opening item, whose sides
//! agree. It is undone only by an appended `unmatched` event with a reason;
//! PostgreSQL refuses a line, entry or opening item in two standing matches.
//! A reconciliation reads its figures at pinned entry, statement, match-event
//! and opening-bridge boundaries, is finalised once its difference is zero by
//! someone other than whoever opened it (or as the ledger's approval exception
//! while the company does not separate duties), and keeps the matches it
//! counted for good.
//!
//! Results are plain records; the schema, SQL and validation stay private.
